# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and lint errors may appear in the console.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information about running tests, see the appropriate section.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

- `npm run eject`: This is a one-way operation. Ejecting removes the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. After ejecting, you're on your own.

  > Note: The curated feature set of Create React App is suitable for small and medium deployments. Ejecting is not mandatory.
